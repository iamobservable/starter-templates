# OWUI base template

The [OWUI Base Template](https://github.com/iamobservable/starter-templates/tree/main/4b35c72a-6775-41cb-a717-26276f7ae56e) is a quick template for setting up Open WebUI. More information can be found 
about configurations on the [Open WebUI Docs](https://docs.openwebui.com/) or the [main Gitub repository](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui).

## üë∑ Template Overview

This template is used in combination with the [Open WebUI Starter project](https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter). After installing the starter project, it can be used to install this template.

## Tooling and Applications

The OWUI template includes the following. A [Service Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/iamobservable/starter-templates/blob/main/4b35c72a-6775-41cb-a717-26276f7ae56e/docs/service-architecture-diagram.md) is also available that describes how the components are connected.

- **[JWT Auth Validator](https://github.com/iamobservable/jwt-auth-validator)**: Provides a service for the Nginx proxy to validate the OWUI token signature for restricting access
- **[Docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve)**: Simplifies document processing, parsing diverse formats ‚Äî including advanced PDF understanding ‚Äî and providing seamless integrations with the gen AI ecosystem (created by IBM)

## JWT Auth Validator Purpose

As this project was being developed, I had a need to restrict access to all web requests to the environment. The initial goal was to restrict the /docs link of a given dev version of OWUI -- it comes out of the box with unrestricted access. I also was using Redis and Searxng and wanted to use the same authentication as OWUI, so as not to require an additional "login" when accessing these sites. So I started researching how OWUI is managing authentication. During the research, I found OWUI creates a [JWT (JSON Web Token)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) during the authentication process. This JWT (JSON Web Token) allows OWUI to verify a user has authenticated by validating the signature created in the JWT. The JWT is stored in the browser as a cookie and passed to any subsequent requests on the same Host + Port (e.g. localhost:4000). Given this pattern, I decided to let the nginx proxy become a gatekeeper of sorts. I setup an nginx configuration to capture the request header for the JWT and pass it to an internal service for verifying the signature. That service is the JWT Auth Validator. Its sole purpose is to tell the nginx proxy if a signature was signed by the appropriate authority -- in this case OWUI -- and return True or False to the nginx proxy. The nginx proxy then, based on a True response, allows the initial request to continue through to the expected service container. If the response is False, nginx will redirect to a /auth route for login.

More can be found about the configuration at [the JWT Auth Validator documentation](https://github.com/iamobservable/jwt-auth-validator?tab=readme-ov-file#nginx-proxy-example).

*For its use in this project, I created an [image for the JWT Auth Validator](https://github.com/iamobservable/jwt-auth-validator/pkgs/container/jwt-auth-validator). This allows a prebuilt docker image that is pulled during the setup process. This eliminates the need to build during the docker compose up step.*
