## Starter Templates

A pre-configured server environment bundled with Docker Compose and configuration files, designed to simplify setup. They authenticate the owner, validate best practices, and enforce security, ensuring a reliable, secure, and standardized foundation for your local or cloud managed server.

As the platform evolves, more templates will be added for other tools and applications, expanding the range of use cases and ensuring a standardized, secure, and best-practice-based environment for any server setup.
